# Diabetes-Prediction
CDC Diabetes health indicators dataset is used is used for this project to illustrate how I go about model selection. I first do predictions with a couple of untuned models, using the train test original data. I then balance the dataset when need, do parameter tuning, apply best thresholds and use PCA (using different variation retantion )
